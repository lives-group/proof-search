This paper shows how to implement a Prolog-style resolution procedure in the dependently typed programming language Agda. Connecting this resolution procedure to Agda's reflection mechanism provides a first-class proof search tactic for first-order Agda terms. As a result, writing proof automation tactics need not be different from writing any other program.",

abstract = "In ordinary lambda calculus the occurrences of a bound variable are made recognizable by the use of one and the same (otherwise irrelevant) name at all occurrences. This convention is known to cause considerable trouble in cases of substitution. In the present paper a different notational system is developed, where occurrences of variables are indicated by integers giving the {"}distance{"} to the binding ¿ instead of a name attached to that ¿. The system is claimed to be efficient for automatic formula manipulation as well as for metalingual discussion. As an example the most essential part of a proof of the Church-Rosser theorem is presented in this namefree calculus.",

As representations we consider regular expressions, deterministic and nondeterministic automata, and Myhill and Nerode partitions. We construct computable functions translating between these representations and show that equivalence of representations is decidable. We also establish the usual closure properties, give a minimization algorithm for DFAs, and prove that minimal DFAs are unique up to state renaming. Our development profits much from Ssreflect's support for finite types and graphs.",

abstract = "The aim of this work is largely a practical one. A widely employed style of programming, particularly in structure-processing languages which impose no discipline of types, entails defining procedures which work well on objects of a wide variety. We present a formal type discipline for such polymorphic procedures in the context of a simple programming language, and a compile time type-checking algorithm W which enforces the discipline. A Semantic Soundness Theorem (based on a formal semantics for the language) states that well-type programs cannot “go wrong” and a Syntactic Soundness Theorem states that if W accepts a program then it is well typed. We also discuss extending these results to richer languages; a type-checking algorithm based on W is in fact already implemented and working, for the metalanguage ML in the Edinburgh LCF system."
